# Sprint 7 project

## Project Description
This project is designed to test the Urban Grocers API using JavaScript and Jest. The API provides access to various endpoints related to products, warehouses, and more. The purpose of the project is to validate the API's responses for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, ensuring the data is correct and the service behaves as expected.

## Documentation Source Used

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for the tests.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for executing code in the backend.
- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework used to write and run tests.
- **fetch API**: Used to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
- **node-fetch**: A module used to implement `fetch` in Node.js environments.

## Project Structure
